Reassembly of one piece axle on rear ISO hub (see Figure 8)
===========================================================
1. Lightly grease threads on adjusting clamp.  Apply two drops of Tri-flow to axle
   O-ring. If using QR adaptors or FunBolts, apply anti-seize to threads before
   threading them into the axle.

2. Apply two drops of Tri-flow to drive shell O-ring.  Insert driveshell into the hub
   shell; turn in a clockwise motion while letting it pull itself in.   A distinctive click
   sound will indicate that the driveshell is firmly seated.

3. Inser t finger from the non-drive side to push spring retainer to ensure Driveshell
   is seated correctly

4. Insert main axle, small end first in to driveshell.  Continue until axle is through the
   hub and large end is firmly seated in driveshell.

5. Thread adjusting clamp onto the protruding threads of axle.

The RingDrive
=============

Inspection
Having removed the axle and driveshell (as instructed in "Disassembly..." pgs 10
and 11) the RingDrive is accessible through the large side of the hub shell.  Visually
inspect the hub's interior.  Under normal conditions the grease should look moist and
may have darkened slightly.  A modest film should coat the moving parts.

As with the rest of the hub, the RingDrive is designed to operate with some water
contamination.  Water intrusion can usually be remedied with basic maintenance.
However, if foreign debris is detectable in the grease and/o r the grease looks hard
or dry, then a complete removal and servicing of the RingDrive is necessary.

Basic maintenance
1. Take a clean, lint free rag and wipe any spent lubricant from inside the hub shell.
   Be careful not to drag any dirt or debris from outside the hub into the interior area.

2. Once the interior is clean in appearance, locate the helical splines of the
   drive ring about an inch inside the large bearing.

3. Using a tooth brush, pull the bristles across the helix in an outward direction.
   Work your way all the way around the inner circumference to remove any
   small particles that may be in the spline grooves.

4. Once completed, wipe the area directly in front of the helix to remove any
   debris.  This method should be used to clean the helix on the driveshell as well.
   (If compressed air is available, blow across the helixes in line with the spline
   grooves to remove any debris).

With the interior wiped down and the helixes brushed clean, a fresh application of
lubricant should be applied. The RingDrive is designed to work with our specially
formulated low shear RingDrive grease.  Do not substitute other brands of grease,
as they may be too sticky for the helix of the RingDrive.

5. Lubricate by reopening a gap between the drive rings, and laying a bead of
   RingDrive grease on the teeth between them.

6. Apply a bead of RingDrive grease to helical splines on driveshell.  Then apply
   a few drops of Tri-flow onto the helical splines and the o-ring of the driveshell.

7. Before reinserting the drive shell into RingDrive area of the hub, the helical
   splines must be clean of any debris. *An optional Stainless Steel driveshell
   is available for riders who are experience above average wear.

8. Proceed to "Reinstallation of the driveshell assembly" pg. 16.

isomanual_8_1_16.pdf, p. 17


Service of the RingDrive
========================
In addition to the basic maintenance of the RingDrive, a complete removal and servicing may be
necessar y. Complete ser vice requires our Hub Ser vice Tool Kit and, as a basic guideline, should
be per formed at least once ever y 12 to 24 months. See any authorized Chris King dealer for
complete service or you may purchase a Hub Service Tool Kit from your dealer or directly from
Chris King Precision Components.  Chris King Precision Components provides overhaul ser-
vices at reasonable rates.  Contact the Customer Service hotline at 800-523-6008 for details.

isomanual_8_1_16.pdf, p. 18


Reinstallation of the driveshell assembly
=========================================
1. Check the helical splines of the driveshell for any particles or debris before
   proceeding; the driveshell must be clean before installing.

2. Apply several drops of Tri-Flow on the helical spline, O-ring, and tapered
   diameter directly adjacent the O-ring. Apply a bead of RingDrive lube to the
   helical splines.

3. Insert driveshell into hubshell, slowly.  As the driveshell enters the RingDrive
   area, it will want to mesh the helical splines of the drivering.  As it begins to
   mesh, a slight clockwise turning motion of the driveshell will help pull it into
   the hub shell.  Continue twisting as the driveshell pulls itself into the hub shell.
   At the bottom of its inward movement, an audible "click" or "pop" sound
   indicates that it has found home and is fully seated. The "click" or "pop" is the
   bearing, indicating the driveshell is fully inserted.  Some pushing pressure on
   the driveshell may be necessary to pop the spring retainer onto the end of
   the driveshell.  You can check to make sure the driveshell is properly seated
   by checking with your fingers from the non-drive side of the hubshell.

4. Test engagement by spinning driveshell in both direc tions. If it does not engage,
   remove driveshell, check cleanliness and reinsert. Retest.

5. The hub is now ready to have the axle installed.

Note: During removal of the driveshell unit the spring retainer plate can become off-
centered. Be sure that the spring retainer is properly centered against the back of the
spring area before reinstalling the driveshell. Make sure the o-ring is correctly seated.

isomanual_8_1_16.pdf, p. 18-19


Service of the bearings (see figure 11)
=======================================
Chris King sealed bearings have removable snap rings that hold the rubber seals
in place.

1. Carefully, using a small screwdriver, pick, or penknife, remove the snap ring by
   inserting tool into split of snap ring.  Gently work one end of the snap ring toward
   bearing center until it is out of its groove.  Follow the ring around with the tool
   until the snap ring is completely dislodged.

2. Lift and remove exposed rubber seal to access the interior of the bearing.

3. Thoroughly flush the bearing with a lightspray lubricant (e.g., WD-40) and
    blow dry.

Note: Some solvents, synthetic lubr icants, and greases with high-pressure additives
      may attack and damage seals and other nonmetallic materials.  Minimize exposure
      to these substances and thoroughly dry hub after cleaning.

4. Wipe dirt and other contaminants from the seals and snap rings.  Avoid
   cleaning the seals with solvent, which could cause deterioration.

5. Lay a bead of our RingDrive grease (see "Lubrication", pg. 6), filling the gap
   between the inner and outer races 3/4 the way around bearing.  Do not
   over fill bearing with lube, as this may cause excess drag.  Rotate the inner
   race to work grease throughout the ball area.

6. Reinstall black rubber seal between inner and outer bearing race.  If using the
   original seal, reinstall using the same orientation as when they were originally
   installed, as this will minimize drag.

7. Insert one edge of snap ring into groove of outer bearing race.  Press along
   entire groove until snap ring is fully seated; a small gap should be visible
   between both ends of the snap ring.

8. Turn inner race of bearing by hand to test for binding.  If bearings do not run
   smooth, repeat steps 1-8. Binding is often a result of improperly seated seals
   and/or snap rings.

Used snap rings and seals can be reinstalled unless warped, punc tured, or other wise
damaged. If damaged, replacement seals and snap rings are available from any
authorized Chris King dealers or directly from Chris King Precision Components.

Universal Disc Brake Rotor Adaptors
===================================
Brake rotor adaptors are used on Universal Disc front and rear hubs to accommodate
ISO and other disc brake systems. These various adaptors are offered in different
widths to correctly position disc brake rotors.  Be sure to use the adaptor designed
for your brake system.  Do not attempt to modify your adaptor to work with rotrs
other than those for which they were designed. M ount the brake rotor according to
manufacturer's instructions.  Rotor mounting bolts should thread 8mm into the rotor
adaptor and must not extend through the brake rotor adaptor or contact the hub.


Installation of rotor adaptor (see Figure 12)
---------------------------------------------
Before installation, thoroughly clean both the brake rotor adaptor and the splines on
the hub shell. Any debris on the splines may not allow the rotor to run true, inhibiting
the performance of the brake.

1. Apply a light amount of grease to rotor adaptor bolts.  Do not use Loc-Tite or
   other sleeving compound to secure rotor adaptor.

2. Place the adaptor on to the splines.  When snug, the adaptor should leave an even
   gap approximately the width of a piece of paper between the hub and the adaptor.

3. Insert the three bolts provided.  In an alter nating pattern, hand tighten adaptor
   bolts to pull adaptor down evenly.
4. Using a 3mm hex wrench, finish torque to 28 inch pounds.  Do not over tighten.


Removal of rotor adaptor (see Figure 12)
----------------------------------------
1. Remove the disc brake rotor if it covers the three mounting bolts.

2. Remove the three adaptor mounting bolts using a 3mm hex wrench.

3. To remove the rotor adaptor from the tapered splines, pr y bet ween the adaptor
   and the hub using t wo opposing plastic tire levers (it should pop off easily). Do
   not use metal objects, such as screw drivers, to release the adaptor.
