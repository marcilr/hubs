spacing.txt
  The spacing of a hub is measured from the outside faces of the cone
  locknuts, where they come into contact with the frame's forkends.
  (Most cartridge-bearing type hubs don't have locknuts, so the spacing
  is measured from the equivalent shoulder surface of the axle ends.)
  The spacing dimension is commonly referred to as the "O.L.D."
