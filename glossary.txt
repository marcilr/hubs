Over-Locknut-Dimension (O.L.D) - The distance between the outermost
  locknuts of a conventional hub axle, or whatever equivalent parts
  fit against the inside surfaces of the fork ends of a frame.  They
  must match the spacing (see chart) of the frame that the wheels
  are to be installed in.

Spacing(Dropout/Axle) - Frame spacing is the inside distance between the
  two fork ends (drop outs), where the wheel fits in.  This can easily be
  measured just by removing the wheel and holding a ruler up to the space
  where the wheel came out.

  Hubs come with various length axles, but the axle length is not as
  critical as the overlocknut distance, since it is the locknuts that
  actually contact the frame ends. Overlocknut distance can't be
  measured directly without a caliper of some sort.

  The dropout spacing of a frame must match the overlocknut distance of
  the wheels that are to fit it.
